今天发生了一件有趣的事情，廷贵哥准备回老家来建房子，准备先把路修好，于是把自己家门口一颗挡路的树砍掉。隔壁的老人家知道他要修路就说他家门口的树也挡路也就一起砍掉，众人帮忙砍掉后，叔叔帮忙把树抬到他家里去，
后面他儿子知道自己家的树被砍掉了，就在花寨大群里面说 “叔叔在没有问过他家任何人的情况就随意砍他家树子” 于是我们就这个事情进行了激烈的辩论。 他上来就发了一大段文字，看得出他应该是有点文化水平的，应该经常讲官话。虽然我不经常讲，但是我有AI啊，这个年代AI面前人人平等，于是我使用AI帮我润色我的文字，
给予强有力的回击，以前他总是在群里高高在上的样子，早就看不惯了。今天出了口恶气，真爽！

Something interesting happened today. Tinggui was planning to go back to our hometown to build a house, and he wanted to fix the road first.
There was a tree blocking the path in front of his house, so he cut it down. When the elderly neighbor heard that he was repairing the road, he said the tree in front of his own house was also blocking the way, so everyone helped cut that one down too. Afterward, my uncle helped carry the tree to the neighbor’s house.

Later, the neighbor’s son found out their tree had been cut, and he immediately complained in the Huazhai group chat, saying “my uncle cut down our tree without asking anyone in our family.”
So a heated debate broke out. He started with a long message—clearly he has some education and likes speaking in an official tone. I don’t usually talk like that, but hey, this is the era of AI, and in front of AI, everyone is equal.

So I let AI polish my response and gave him a strong counter-argument.
He always acted superior in the group, and I’ve been annoyed for a long time.
Today I finally put him in his place. It felt great!
