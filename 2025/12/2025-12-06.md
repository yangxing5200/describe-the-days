今天在家将Pronunciation Coach 的功能完善了，使用了阿里的FunASR 来做语音对齐，效果很好，开心啊
Today I optimtion the Pronuncition Cocah features, use FunASR from alibaba to voicealign, it is running well, so happy.
1. 拼写错误

optimtion → optimized

Pronuncition Cocah → Pronunciation Coach

voicealign → voice alignment

2. 语法问题

“Today I optimized … use FunASR …” 两个动词缺乏连接词，应使用 and 或 by。

“it is running well” 可以更自然地表达成 “it works really well”。

3. 表达更自然的方式

“so happy” 可以更自然地说 “I’m really happy about it”。

Today I improved the features of Pronunciation Coach and intergrated Alibaba's FunASR for voice alignment. It's works really well, and I'm really happpy about the results.
