今天去野生动物园玩了，看到了好多动物，有颜色鲜艳的鹦鹉，天鹅，熊猫，还有一些忘记名字的奇怪动物，最让我映像深刻的是大的动物，比如长颈鹿、非洲象、亚洲象，对了还有浣熊是真的好可爱。还有松鼠猴好小啊。
回来的路上我买了菠菜和水果，我要赶紧补充VC，吃完蔬菜和水果，嘴巴里的苦味明显少了很多。
Spent the day at the safari park! I saw so many animals—vibrant parrots, elegant swans, pandas, and some exotic creatures whose names I can’t even recall. The giants like the giraffes, African elephants, and Asian elephants were truly stunning. Oh, and the raccoons were absolutely adorable, while the squirrel monkeys were tiny!

On the way back, I picked up some spinach and fruit to load up on Vitamin C. After eating them, that bitter taste in my mouth has already faded quite a bit
