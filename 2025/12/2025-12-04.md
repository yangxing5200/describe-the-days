今天继续部署Pronunciation coach， 因为VPN流量不是很充沛，所以我在执行命令的时候更加谨慎。昨天无数次的尝试把Copilot Pro的 premium request 次数全用光了，这可是一个月的量被我3天用光了，不敢相信！
由于这两天一直没有把这个环境的问题解决，很是挫败感，回到家一直在打游戏放松，但是发现游戏也没打好，挫败感翻倍。
最后到晚上十点过的时候我想重新尝试一次，我给AI的提示词更加精准了，我让他不要覆盖我现有的Pytouch版本，每个安装包我都加上了 -no-deps ，终于，终于 都装好了,WhisperX 正常运行了，我只开始了1秒钟，因为时间已经来到了12点半，我必须立刻去休息，我已经连续熬夜3天了。


This is tried to deploy Pronunciation coach offline another day, My VPN data is almost used up, so every actions I do it carefuly. My Copilot Pro premium request is used up at yesterday, I used up a month budget in 3 days, It is amzing.
The enviroment is still not working, I realy frustrated, I decided to play game, and the game is loss, I realy frustrated again.
finaly I decided one more try to deploy the WhiperX, in this trun I use premium tokens and tell it don't overwite my Pytouch, and use commond '-no-deps' when install packages. in the end the WhisperX is working, it is working!
the time over 12PM, I must go bed to sleep right now.

1. 拼写错误

carefuly → carefully

Copilot Pro 的 premium request → premium requests

amzing → amazing

enviroment → environment

realy → really

game is loss → 应该是 I lost the game

trun → turn

commond → command

Pytouch → PyTorch

WhiperX → WhisperX

12PM → 应该是 12:30 AM（你说晚上 12 点半）

2. 语法问题

“This is tried to deploy…” → 句子结构不对

“every actions I do it carefully” → actions/action, 结构不对

“It is amzing.” → 情绪表达弱

“I realy frustrated again.” → 缺动词（am）

3. 表达不够自然

时态多处混乱（过去式 / 现在式）

情绪表达不够地道

句子有时像逐字翻译，不像自然表达
I tried to deploy Pronunciation Coach again today. My VPN data is almost gone, so I ran every command carefully. Yesterday I even used up all my Copilot Pro premium requests in only three days.

After failing for two days, I felt really frustrated. I tried playing games to relax, but I played terribly, which made me feel even worse.

At around 10 p.m., I tried one more time. I asked the AI more precisely, told it not to overwrite PyTorch, and used `--no-deps`. Finally, WhisperX worked!

But it was already 12:30 a.m., and I had to sleep. It was my third night staying up late.
