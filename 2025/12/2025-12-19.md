今天约了曹老师，春哥一起小聚，吃了个烧烤喝了几瓶啤酒，算是跨年了。大家都在聊AI改变了我们的工作方式，也在聊曹老师的幸福问题。然后再聊聊最近的想法。这种感觉挺好的，在这个大城市，能有几个好友出来吃饭真的是一种奢望。

Tonight, I met up with Sonny and Corey for a small gathering. We had barbecue and a few bottles of beer — nothing fancy, just a simple way of welcoming the New Year.

We talked about how AI is quietly reshaping the way we work, how fast everything is changing, and where we might fit into it all. There was also some half-serious, half-playful talk about Teacher Cao’s happiness and personal life, which brought a lot of laughter.

Later, the conversation drifted to our recent thoughts — work, life, uncertainty, and the things we don’t usually say out loud.

The whole evening felt warm and grounding. In a city this big, moments like these feel rare. Being able to sit down, eat, drink, and talk with a few close friends is quietly luxurious.

Walking home afterward, I realized how much I needed this — not the food or the beer, but the sense of connection. It reminded me that even in a fast, crowded city, there are still small moments that make everything feel human.
