今天晚上回来的时候和家里开了个视频会议，我们讨论老家的院子该如何重建，我发现了叔叔有一个问题坏习惯，他在还没有想好如何重建的情况下，已经准备去买材料了，还好我及时叫停。
这像极了我之前的做事风格，比较鲁莽，最后碰了一鼻子的灰，最后事情还没有办好。我的建议是既然要重建，那就想好了一次做好，不要花了钱最后做得大家都不满意，如果是差钱我可以支持。
最后我们达成一致，先找专业的人来看一下，设计好方案最后再进行施工。

今天晚上回来的时候和家里开了一个视频会议,I had a video meeting with my family in the evening,“今天晚上回来的时候”用“in the evening”表达太简化。在描述经历时，更自然地表达是“When I got home this evening...” 或 “... after I got back home this evening.”,When I got home this evening...
我们讨论老家的院子该如何重建,we are talk about rebuild the yard at hometown,动词时态和形式错误：we are talk (应为 we are talking 或 we talked about)；“rebuild”是动词，前应加介词；“at hometown”不自然。,we talked about rebuilding the yard at our hometown / back home.
我发现叔叔有一个问题坏习惯,I got a issue with my uncle,“got a issue” 不自然，且“issue”应为可数名词 an issue；“坏习惯”更贴切的表达是 a habit/tendency。,I noticed an issue/problem with my uncle...
他在还没有想好如何重建的情况下,he hasn't the whole plan about rebuild the yard,语法错误：he hasn't (应为 he doesn't have 或 he hadn't developed); “rebuild the yard” 应为名词形式。,he doesn't have a complete plan for the rebuilding of the yard.
他已经准备去买材料了,but he want to buy some metireal in the termorow,"Want 动词形式错误（应为 wants）；单词拼写错误：material (材料), tomorrow (明天)。",but he wanted to buy some materials tomorrow.
我必须叫停,I must stop it.,“必须”用 must 略显生硬，更自然地表达是“我不得不阻止”或“我及时制止了”。,I had to stop him / I managed to stop him just in time.
这像极了我之前的做事风格,It must be like my past experinse,Must be 是推测，用 It reminded me of 更贴切；单词拼写错误：experience (经历)。,It reminded me of my past experience.
做事没有计划，最后事情还没有办好,"do something without plan, in the end nothing is well done",应该使用完成时态或过去式；“in the end nothing is well done” 太笼统。,"doing things without a plan, where nothing was ever well done."
我认为我们必须先制定好计划再按计划进行,I think we must be have done a plan and forward the plan to do anything,语法错误：must be have done 完全错误。表达“必须先制定计划”即可。,I think we must finalize a plan first...
我可以支持一些预算/差钱我可以支持,I can support some budget.,表达太简略，可以更清晰地表达为“如果预算有问题，我可以提供支持”。,I can offer some financial support if the budget is an issue.
最终我们决定，先找专业的人来看一下,"In the end we are decided, find a profinshnal person to do it.",语法错误：we are decided (应为 we decided)；单词拼写错误：professional (专业的)。,"In the end, we decided to find a professional..."

版本一：口语化自然表达 (More Conversational)
"I had a video call with my family this evening to talk about rebuilding the yard back home. I immediately noticed an issue with my uncle: he was already planning to buy materials tomorrow, even though he didn't have a complete plan for the project.

I had to stop him! It reminded me so much of my own past experience of rushing things without a plan, only to end up with a mess and nothing properly done. I told them that since we're going to rebuild, we need to plan it out properly and do it right the first time, so everyone is satisfied. I also offered to pitch in some money if the budget was a concern.

In the end, we all agreed to find a professional to design a proper solution before we start construction."

📌 版本二：更正式和专业的表达 (More Formal)
"When I got home this evening, I had a video conference with my family to discuss the reconstruction of our family yard. A concern arose regarding my uncle's approach: he intended to purchase materials the following day, despite not having developed a comprehensive design or plan.

I felt it was necessary to intervene and stop this premature action. This tendency to rush without preparation mirrored my own past mistakes, which often resulted in poorly executed projects. My advice was that if we are undertaking a rebuild, we must first secure a well-thought-out plan to ensure the work is done correctly and to everyone’s satisfaction. I also confirmed my willingness to provide financial assistance if budget limitations were a factor.

Ultimately, we reached a consensus: we will first consult with a professional designer to finalize the plan before commencing any actual construction."
