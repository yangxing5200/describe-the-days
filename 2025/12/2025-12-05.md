今天和老婆聊天的时候，聊起让妈妈和叔叔来上海打工，在焕姐他们那边工地上班，这个提议感觉还不错，这样子一家人都在上海，平时见面的时间就更多了。不过在此之前，她需要先去医院动手术，等过完年再来。
Toddy Jianfen told me a news about mom and uncle will go to work in shanghai, they are will going to a company same sister Huan, I think that a great, it will be more meets at shagnhai,
before that Mom have to do a resolve at hospital, they will be going shanghai in next year.


❗ 问题点评
1. 人名和关系表达问题

Toddy Jianfen 不太像自然的英文人名表达，可直接用 “my wife Jianfen” 或 “Jianfen”。

“sister Huan” 容易让英语读者以为是亲妹妹。你要表达的是“焕姐”，应使用 “Sister Huan”（昵称）或 “Huan”。

2. 语法错误

“told me a news” → news 是不可数名词，不能加 “a”。

“they are will going” → 错误的时态堆叠，应为 “they will go”。

“a company same sister Huan” → 不自然，应该是 “the same company as Sister Huan”。

3. 表达不自然或不准确

“resolve at hospital” 不自然，手术应该说 “have a surgery” / “undergo a surgery”。

“it will be more meets” → 不自然，可以说 “we’ll get to see each other more often”。

“going shanghai” → 缺少 “to”。

4. 逻辑表达混乱

句子结构松散，事件顺序不清晰，需要分成清晰的几句来讲。

Jianfen told me that Mom and my uncle might come to Shanghai to work, at the same construction company where Sister Huan works
I think it's a great idea - our family would get to see each other much more often.
But before that, Mom need to have a surgery, so they'll probably come after the New Year.
