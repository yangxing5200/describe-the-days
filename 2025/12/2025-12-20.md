Shen Jun introduced an ERP project to me. I had a call with the client today to clarify the requirements, which seem straightforward. My main concern is that the client is based in Ninbo, and they haven't fully committed to the project yet. 
I've finished drafting the requirements document am now waiting for their feedback.
