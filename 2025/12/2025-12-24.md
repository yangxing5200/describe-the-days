今天带儿子去都匀打预防针，可是早上发现都匀没有药了，后面大姐带着去长顺打的预防针。为了打这个预防针她们先是去了凤山，后面又差点去马场坪，现在来了都匀还没打成，最后还要跑到长顺，真的太不容易了。还好有大姐在一路车接车送。
现在大姐她们富裕了，感觉挺好的。在可见的未来如果我还是继续这份工作的话，我们的差距只会越来越大，还是有点压力的。我也想让家里过得更好一点。想改变我们的生活环境。不想在外漂泊了。

I took my son to Duyun for his vaccination today, only to find out they were out of stock. My eldest sister ended up driving us all the way to Changshun to get it done. To get this shot, they first went to Fengshan and almost headed to Machangping. After all that effort, we still couldn't get it in Duyun and had to rush to Changshun. It was such a struggle, but luckily my sister was there the whole time, driving us around and making sure we were taken care of.

Now that my sister's family is well-off, I feel genuinely happy for them. However, it also brings a sense of pressure—if I stay in this current job, the gap between us will only keep widening. I want a better life for my family too. I want to change our living environment and stop this life of drifting away from home. I truly want to give my family a more stable and comfortable future.
