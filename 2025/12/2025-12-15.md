犹豫了几天，我今天还是决定做有声小说配音工具 EchoSoul，尽管这个难度很大，但是实现后也非常有意思也非常能吸金。风险就是灰产，可能有法律风险。我只想说船到桥头自然直。

After hesitating for several days, I finally decided today to build an audiobook narration tool called EchoSoul.

Even though the technical difficulty is high, once it’s done, it will be both fascinating to work on and highly monetizable.

The main risk is that this area can easily drift into grey zones, with potential legal issues.

But I believe that when the ship reaches the bridge, a way forward will naturally appear.
