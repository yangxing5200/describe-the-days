昨天晚上做了个噩梦，梦见我被开除了，可能是因为公司同事一直在内卷，让我产生了精神内耗，还是自己内心不够强大啊！

Last night I did a amazing dream, It is I am be fired by my boss, maybe It is my workmates always roll rats, it make me some paareshare, I think it is I have't a big heart.

❌ 原句中的问题
1. “amazing dream”用错了

Amazing 是“很棒、很惊喜”的意思。

做噩梦应该用 bad dream / nightmare。

2. “It is I am be fired by my boss” 语法混乱

“It is” 多余

“am be fired” 不正确，应使用被动语态：I was fired / I got fired (in my dream)

3. “workmates always roll rats” 完全不是英文表达

“内卷” 英语没有直接对应，可用：

overwork / work overtime a lot

keep pushing themselves too hard

the competitive atmosphere

toxic overworking culture

4. “paareshare” 拼写错误且不存在这个单词

你想表达的是“压力 / 精神内耗”

可用：stress / mental stress / anxiety / mental exhaustion

5. “I have't a big heart” 不地道

英语中不会这样表达

更自然：I’m not mentally strong enough / maybe I'm too sensitive

Last night I had a nightmare that I got fired.
Maybe it’s because my coworkers keep overworking and creating a stressful atmosphere, which makes me feel mentally exhausted.
Perhaps I’m just not feeling strong enough inside lately.

I had a nightmare last night that I got fired. I think the rat race at work is really messing with my head. I guess I just need a thicker skin
