今天是星期一，昨天晚上没有睡好，因为楼上的邻居半夜在吵闹，把我吵醒了，导致我醒来的时候已经7.26，中途还做了不少梦。值得开心的是周末给电瓶车充满了电，骑起来飞快。今天在公司正常节奏，早上过进度，中午11.45吃饭，12.02 给和老婆开视频看看家人，12.25回到工位上看几分钟手机然后睡觉到13.00,然后下午3点左右日常带薪拉屎，18点左右正常下班，回来的路上没有骑到共享单车，比较可惜。今天我做了一个决定，我要尝试用英文来描述我的一天，具体计划是先中文写出来。然后用英文去翻译，然后用ai把自己的话润色，然后再翻译，最好让AI帮我翻译。

今天是星期一。昨晚没睡好，因为楼上的邻居半夜吵闹，把我吵醒了。醒来的时候已经是早上 7 点 26 分。中途还做了不少梦。
值得开心的是，周末我给电瓶车充满了电，今天骑起来特别顺畅，速度飞快。

今天在公司一切照常。早上开会汇报进度，中午 11 点 45 分吃饭，12 点 02 分和老婆视频，看看家人。12 点 25 分回到工位，刷了几分钟手机就睡觉，一直睡到 1 点。
下午 3 点左右例行去厕所（笑），算是带薪放松。6 点准时下班。
回家路上没抢到共享单车，有点小遗憾。

今天我做了一个决定：我要尝试用英文来描述我的每一天。
计划是这样的——先用中文写出来，再自己翻译成英文，然后请 AI 帮我润色，最后再用 AI 翻译回中文看看差别。
希望这个过程能让我一点点提高英语，也能更好地记录生活。

AI translate:
Today is Monday.
I didn’t sleep well last night because my upstairs neighbor was making noise around 2 a.m., which woke me up. After that, I had several dreams in a short time.

I finally got up at 7:26 a.m. The good thing is that my electric bike was fully charged — I charged it on Sunday, and it ran really fast today.

It was a normal Monday at work. We had our progress meeting in the morning, then I had lunch at 11:45 a.m. Around 12:02, I made a video call with my wife and saw my son, WenYu. After that, I went back to my desk, watched a few videos, and took a nap until 1:00 p.m.

Around 3 p.m., I went to the toilet for a quick five-minute break (my usual afternoon routine 😄). I finished work at around 6:40 p.m. On my way home, I couldn’t find a shared bike, which was a bit disappointing.

Today, I made an important decision: I’m going to try to describe my days in English.
My plan is: first, write everything in Chinese; second, translate it into English; third, use AI to polish the sentences; fourth, compare the results; and finally, keep improving day by day.
