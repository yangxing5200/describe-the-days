最近电脑经常死机，我怀疑是电压不够，然后进入Bois中将cpu和内存的供电电压调整了，第一次调整过后没多久电脑就蓝屏重启了，于是我又做了一些调整发现情况更糟糕了，于是我再次进行调整，终于电脑完全无法启动了，主板上亮了一颗故障灯。
通过抖音查了B450M的故障灯发现是CPU故障灯，当时慌得一批，心想不要把CPU搞烧了吧，问了GPT GPT给的建议是让我把主板电池拔掉，强行重置主板设置。
于是我把主机拿到电灯下，打开机箱，拆掉内存，拆掉显卡，终于发现了传说中的主板电池，于是用工具将主板电池拆下来，过了几分钟重新装上去。我害怕内存也有问题，空主板尝试点亮，发现故障灯已经变了，悬着的心也放下来了一点。
最后我把内存、显卡都安装上去再次开机，我真的是太幸运了，电脑成功点亮。于是我把xmp、开机启动重新在Bois中设置好。真的是好刺激，差点以为我的电脑坏了。

Recently my computer aways force reboot or clash, I think it is power level not enugh, so I reboot my computer and enter the BOIS system and setting the memory elc and CPU elc, it is running a few minutes then clash, I decided to setting again,
finnly I reboot the computer but it did't running.  it's clash again. I open the computer box and find a red light.
I search the satution from the ticktok, and ask the GPT ,there are give me same answer is reset the bois, so i try to reset the bois ,the 1step i take off rarm and GPU ,finny i reset the computer it is running again ,i am so happy.

你的英文原文中常见的问题包括：

1. 拼写错误（spelling）

BOIS → BIOS

elc → voltage

clash → crash

finny → finally

rarm → RAM

2. 语法不准确（grammar）

“my computer aways force reboot or clash” → my computer kept crashing or force-rebooting

“I think it is power level not enugh” → I suspected it was a voltage issue

“it is running a few minutes then clash” → it ran for a few minutes and then crashed

3. 表达不自然（unnatural expressions）

“setting the memory elc and CPU elc” → adjusting the CPU and RAM voltages

“i am so happy” → I felt extremely relieved

“I open the computer box” → I opened the case

4. 叙述逻辑不太清晰（flow is not smooth）

你的中文逻辑很清楚，但英文翻译有点跳跃。

Recently, my computer kept crashing or force-rebooting. I suspected it was a voltage issue, so I entered the BIOS and tried adjusting the CPU and RAM voltages. After the first adjustment, the system ran for only a few minutes before crashing again. I made more changes, but things got even worse — eventually the computer wouldn’t boot at all, and a red warning light appeared on the motherboard.

I looked it up on TikTok and found out that on the B450M, the red light usually indicates a CPU issue. I panicked, thinking I might have damaged my CPU. I also asked GPT, and the suggestion was to reset the BIOS by removing the motherboard battery.

So I opened the case, took out the RAM and GPU, and finally located the CMOS battery on the motherboard. I removed it, waited a few minutes, then reinstalled it. I first tried booting with only the motherboard powered on, and the warning light changed — which already eased my worries.

After reinstalling the RAM and GPU, I powered it on again. To my relief, the system successfully booted. I went back into the BIOS, re-enabled XMP and my startup settings. It was such a thrilling experience — I really thought I had broken my computer.

So lately my PC kept crashing and randomly rebooting. I figured it must be some kind of voltage issue, so I went into the BIOS and started messing with the CPU and RAM voltages. It ran fine for a few minutes… then boom — another crash. I tweaked the settings again, and this time things got way worse. The system completely refused to boot, and my motherboard lit up with a red warning LED.

I checked TikTok and found out that on the B450M, the red light usually means a CPU problem. I instantly panicked — like, oh great, I probably just fried my CPU. I even asked GPT, and it told me to reset the BIOS by pulling the CMOS battery.

So I opened up the case, took out the RAM and GPU, and went hunting for that tiny battery. Finally found it, pulled it out, waited a couple minutes, and popped it back in. I tried powering on the board with no RAM or GPU, and the error light actually changed. At that point I was like, okay, maybe there’s still hope.

Then I reinstalled everything, hit the power button… and it actually booted. I swear, I’ve never felt so relieved in my life. Went back into BIOS, turned XMP and my usual settings back on, and everything worked.

Honestly, that whole process was way more intense than it needed to be. For a second I really thought I had completely killed my PC.
