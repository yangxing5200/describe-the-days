今天是被AI折磨的一天，晚上回家准备用GPT来分析下项目结构，他告诉我我的项目中有严重的设计缺陷，并且我觉得他说的很对，于是我花钱买了会员，再进行深入交流后我发现他完全不懂大局，在那瞎扯淡。给我整崩溃了。

AI always terrible my life, today I tried to used GPT optimized my project, GPT tell me that my project has some big bug and I think it is right, so I decided subscribe it a month. When I subscribed and had more chats I realize that It is a liener to me. It so crazy.

AI always makes my life miserable. Today I tried using GPT to analyze my project. It told me my project had some serious design flaws, and at first I thought it was right. So I decided to subscribe for a month. But after having more chats, I realized it didn’t understand the big picture at all and was just talking nonsense. It drove me crazy.


优化点总结：

时态和语法修正：原文 “tell me that my project has some big bug” → “told me my project had some serious design flaws”。

自然用词：

“a liener to me” → “just talking nonsense / making stuff up”。

“it so crazy” → “it drove me crazy / I was so frustrated”。

逻辑顺序更清晰：先描述尝试 → 相信 → 订阅 → 失望 → 情绪。
