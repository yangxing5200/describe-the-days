135迭代的需求终于评审完毕了，所有任务都拆解完成并分批，135迭代正式开始。今天听说这个迭代的任务量上浮了50%，因为老板觉得之前上浮30%我们没有加班，觉得我们在虚报工时，可笑的是公司把加班餐都取消了，现在想让我们加班。真的是不要脸！

 Today the Sprint 135 is start , all of the tasks has been assign. someone tell me a message that the boss decided up 50% 后面不太好翻译。

The requirements for Sprint 135 are finally reviewed, and all the tasks have been broken down and assigned. Sprint 135 has officially started.
Today I heard that the workload for this sprint has increased by 50%, because the boss thought we didn’t work overtime when it was only increased by 30% last time, and assumed we were inflating our estimates. The ridiculous part is that the company even canceled overtime meals, and now they want us to work overtime. Absolutely shameless!
