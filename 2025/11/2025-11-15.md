又是一个coding 的周末，早上起来就开始写代码，我发现做自己喜欢的事情，会有使不完的动力。今天不想做饭，点了炸鸡，还在天猫超市上买了6瓶老干妈，因为有券只花了27块钱，相当于4块5左右一瓶，好便宜。

完美自然的英文版本（推荐）

It’s another coding Saturday. I started coding as soon as I woke up. I’ve realized that when you’re doing something you love, you never run out of energy.
I didn’t feel like cooking today, so I ordered fried chicken. I also bought six bottles of Laoganma on Tmall—there was a coupon, so all six only cost 27 RMB, about 4.5 RMB each. Such a great deal!

🔍 你原文中的问题点（帮你指出来）

Saturday 不用小写（专有名词）

when I woke up I did coding → 不自然，应说 started coding

I got a really interesting things is… → 语法错误

power 用来表达“动力”不自然，用 energy / motivation

I don’t want cooking → 应该是 I didn’t feel like cooking

call a quick meal from internet → 完全不地道，应为 order takeout / order fried chicken

cheep 拼写错误 → cheap

tmall just speed 27 RMB → spent 27 RMB

⭐ 如果你想感情色彩更强一点：

It’s another coding-heavy Saturday. I started writing code right after getting up. When you’re doing what you love, the motivation just keeps coming.
Didn’t feel like cooking today, so I ordered some fried chicken. And I scored a crazy deal on Tmall—six bottles of Laoganma for only 27 RMB after coupons. Amazing!
