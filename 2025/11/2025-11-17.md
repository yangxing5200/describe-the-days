今天大降温啊，早上出门的时候还不算特别冷，晚上回来的路上骑电瓶车，手指头都感觉不是自己的了，回到家我准备喝一口酒暖暖身子。很久不喝白酒了，才喝了一两不到 感觉已经快醉了。

Today the tempture is large down. It was not cold in the morning but when I come back the way i feel so cold, I want drink some wine to warm body, I just drink a little bug I feel like drinked.

❌ 存在的问题

tempture → 应该是 temperature

“large down” 不自然，可以用 dropped a lot / dropped sharply

come back the way 语法不对

I want drink some wine to warm body → to warm my body

a little bug → 变成了“小虫子” 😂 应该是 a little bit

I feel like drinked → drink 的过去分词是 drunk，不过这里用 I already felt tipsy 更自然

一些时态和语序需要调整

✅ 我给你的改进版（自然、地道）

Today the temperature dropped a lot. It wasn’t very cold in the morning, but on my way home tonight I felt freezing. When I got home, I had a little bit of liquor to warm myself up. I haven’t had white liquor for a long time, so even after just a small sip, I already felt a bit tipsy.

✅ 更口语化一点的版本

It got really cold today. It wasn’t bad in the morning, but riding my e-bike home tonight, my fingers almost went numb. When I got back, I had a small sip of liquor to warm up. I haven’t had baijiu in a long time, so even that tiny sip made me feel tipsy.
