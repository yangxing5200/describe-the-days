## 做梦
- 昨天晚上做了个噩梦，梦见几个三个内侄子很调皮捣蛋，还跟我顶嘴，我后面一怒之下用锤子在小内侄的头上敲了个大窟窿，奇怪的是他人好像没多大事情，但是我被下醒来了，一看手机才5点。

## 早餐
- 和往常一样早上7.35起来煮面条吃，一边煮一边玩手机，等发现快煮好的时候想起自己还没有刷牙，刷牙回来的时候发现面条煮太久了都坨了，这是个失败的早餐。

## 上班的路上
- 给电瓶车充满了电就是爽，骑起来很快，一路绿灯，今天居然赶上了8.33的车

## 上班
- 今天是忙碌的一天，还有一些需求不是很明确的地方需要和产品进行沟通，中午的时候想是不是要喝一瓶咖啡。后面感觉不是很困，就没有喝了。下午一直在赶进度很忙碌。

## 下班
18.42 每天基本上都是这个点左右下班，在公司门口没有看到共享单车，但是在美团APP上看到附近有车，就跟着导航去找，结果没有找到车。于是 继续跟着华夏中路的路上走了10分钟左右才找到车。

## 其他
- 早上问grok 在贵州只有5万，如何实现年入100万，grok给出的方案有三个方向。 第一个是直播带货，标题大学生回家中菌子 用视频记录平时中菌子的过程拍成视频，然后直播卖菌子。第二个是帮乡亲们注册网店，支持销售到国外去。第三个是去旅游景点附近盘个店铺做纹绣。感觉都不是特别靠谱，第一个能做但是我不是很看到这个前景，第二个 现在是没有头绪，第三个 自己没有纹绣相关的经验也没有人脉。
- 昨天的文章写得一塌糊涂，markdown的语法全忘记了，今天特意去重新学习了，今天的排版就好看很多。

1️⃣ Dream

你写的：

I had a dream about that I attack my nephew because they are so naughty , I use a hammer to atttack him head, unbliveable things happen, his head did't even bleed. it's suppise to me woke up.

问题和改进点：

“attack my nephew because they are so naughty” → 时态和代词不一致，“nephews” 应该用复数，如果想强调一个用 he

“I use a hammer to attack him head” → 动词时态、介词错误，应该 “I used a hammer on his head”

拼写错误：atttack → attack, unbliveable → unbelievable, did't → didn’t, suppise → surprised

语序和逻辑不够自然，最后一句应该明确 “I was woken up by surprise”

改进版：

I had a nightmare where my nephews were being so naughty and even talked back to me. In a moment of anger, I hit one of them on the head with a hammer. Strangely, he didn’t seem hurt at all, but I was shocked and woke up.

2️⃣ Breakfast

你写的：

I wake up at 7.35AM, then cook some noodle as my breakfast. during cooking I watch videos forget the time is lost, when I remerber the time ,it so late .the noodle is too soft. it's a fail bearkfast.

问题和改进点：

时态统一：日记一般用过去式 “woke up”

拼写：rember → remember, bearkfast → breakfast

语法：watch videos forget → forgot while watching videos

“it so late” → it was already late

改进版：

I woke up at 7:35 AM and started cooking noodles for breakfast. While cooking, I got distracted watching videos and lost track of time. When I remembered, it was already too late and the noodles had overcooked. It was a failed breakfast.

3️⃣ On the way to work

你写的：

it's a happy things what charge my elc-bike fully, ride the elc-bike so fast, when I arrived the subway station just 8.32AM

问题和改进点：

“it's a happy things” → uncountable, 用 “It feels great”

拼写：elc-bike → e-bike

时态：应该过去式

“when I arrived the subway station just 8.32AM” → “I arrived at the subway station at exactly 8:32 AM”

改进版：

It felt great to have fully charged my e-bike. Riding it was so fast, and I arrived at the subway station at exactly 8:32 AM.

4️⃣ Work day

你写的：

it's a busy day, i have to argment with PM to clear some requeriments detail, i did like to drinking a bottle of coffee,in the end i did't because i feel it's not too tire. but it's a busy in whole day.

问题和改进点：

时态统一：用过去式

拼写：argment → argue, requeriments → requirements, did't → didn’t, tire → tired

“i did like to drinking a bottle of coffee” → “I wanted to drink a bottle of coffee”

“it's a busy in whole day” → “It was a busy day”

改进版：

It was a busy day. I had to discuss some unclear requirement details with the PM. I wanted to drink a bottle of coffee at lunch, but in the end, I didn’t because I didn’t feel very tired. The whole afternoon was spent rushing to meet deadlines.

5️⃣ On the way home

你写的：

I usually get off work at 18.40 - same today, i saw a share bike in the MT App, but i did not find it, in the end i kept walking on my way home until find a bike.

问题和改进点：

时态过去式

拼写：share bike → shared bike

“until find a bike” → “until I found a bike”

“same today” → “same as today” 或 “which was the case today”

改进版：

I usually get off work at 6:40 PM, and it was the same today. I saw a shared bike on the Meituan app, but couldn’t find it. In the end, I kept walking on my way home for about 10 minutes before finally finding a bike.

6️⃣ Other

你写的：

i ask a question to gork, how to make million of a year use 50k as start. it give me 3 options,1: sales on the internet,2: help somebody create a online shop, 3:buy a new shop near the scenic area.
i study to use markdown .

问题和改进点：

时态过去式

拼写：gork → Grok, a online shop → an online shop, study to use → studied how to use

语法：how to make million of a year → how to make a million a year

改进版：

I asked Grok how to make a million a year starting with only 50,000 RMB. It gave me three options: 1) sell products online, 2) help local people create online shops, 3) open a shop near a tourist attraction.
I also studied how to use Markdown.
