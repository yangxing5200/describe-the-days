今天早上去帮老婆孩子交了上海的医保，下午在家里写了一整个下午的的代码，又把Atlas的架构整体的重构了一番。架构真不是一般人玩得转的东西。


I helped my wife and kid take care of  their Shanghai medical insurance this morning. Then I spent the whole afternoon at home coding, and even reworkd the entire Atlas architecture.

Honestly, architecture isn't something just anyone can deal with.
