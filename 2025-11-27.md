语序错误（中文直译）

“talk about with my wife” 不自然

“has a trabble” 拼写错误（trouble）

“I don't solution to fix it” 语法不成立

需要表达“我不知道怎么处理”

✅ 地道英文

I haven’t had a real, meaningful conversation with my wife for a long time.
I can feel that her relationship with my mom has become a bit tense, and I’m not sure how to improve the situation.

最近部落冲突18本难度增加了很多，玩得有点上瘾。
Recently the clans of clash level 18th has upgrade the attack difficut. so excting.

⭐ 点评

游戏名应该是 Clash of Clans

“level 18th” 应为 Town Hall 18

“has upgrade the attack difficult” 不符合英文逻辑

“so excting” 应是 exciting

✅ 地道英文

Recently Clash of Clans has become much harder after upgrading to Town Hall 18,
and honestly, I’m getting a bit addicted to it.


学英语一直停留在想学好的阶段，很是尴尬啊！有一万种方法学好，但是一个方法都不去用。
improve my English always stay in the plan, so unberss?  I have 10k solutions to imporve my english skill but I never use one.

⭐ 点评

“stay in the plan” 不自然

“so unberss?” 可能想说 embarrassing

“10k solutions” 可以保留口语风格

句子结构略乱

✅ 地道英文

My English learning always stays at the “I want to improve” stage, which is really embarrassing.
I have thousands of ways to get better, but I don’t actually use any of them.
