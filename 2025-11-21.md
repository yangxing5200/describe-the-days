今天在公司开了一天的会，在评审135的需求，下个迭代估计又是很忙咯，话说回来，忙点好啊，有活干工作才稳定。
Today I am always in the meeting, we are review the sprint 135 requirements, It realize heavy works, next sprint must be heavy, any way I need job a long time banlance job.

语法错误较多（时态、单复数、用词不当）。

句子结构不够自然，像机器直译，不太符合英语表达习惯。

部分词语拼写错误（如 banlance 应为 balance）。

英文逻辑表达需要更清晰，尤其是“忙一点好，有活干才稳定”的意思。

I spent the whole day in meetings at the company, reviewing the requirements for Sprint 135. 
It looks like the next sprint is going to be very busy again.

But on the other hand, being busy is good - having work to do means the job is stable.

I was meeting all day reviewing the Sprint 135 requirments. Looks like next sprint is going to be another busy one.
But honestly, being busy isn't a bad thing - it means the job is stable.
