经过一个月的打磨，我的 EchoSoul 功能越来越完善了，但是昨天我发现了一个致命的问题，就是调用本地的tts经常出现蓝屏。于是使用了AI进行解决，对着电脑各种改设置，最后不仅没有任何改善，甚至出现了更加频繁的蓝屏。

今天，我下定决心使用智算云扉来部署TTS，折腾了一上午终于把流程跑通了，也增加了使用云端或者本地的开关，目前看来这个项目真可以说是1.0版本正式可以发布了。

After a full month of constant polishing, EchoSoul has finally reached a point where its features feel truly solid.
But just yesterday, I ran into a fatal problem: calling the local TTS service kept causing blue screen crashes.

I tried to fix it with the help of AI, tweaking all kinds of system settings and digging deep into the machine.
In the end, not only did nothing improve — the blue screens actually became even more frequent.

So today, I made a firm decision: move the TTS to the cloud.

I chose Zhisan Cloud, spent the entire morning deploying and debugging, and finally got the whole pipeline running smoothly. I also added a switch so EchoSoul can now choose between cloud-based or local TTS.

At this point, it really feels like this project has crossed an important line.
I can finally say it out loud:

EchoSoul 1.0 is officially ready to be released.
