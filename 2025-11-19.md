今天在公司把Atlas的事务模块完善了，回到家喝了点白酒，感觉好困啊，想睡觉了。

Today I had fininshed the UnitOfWork for Atlas, and I go back home drunk some baijiu, so tire and want to sleep.

你原文中的主要问题：

1. 拼写错误

fininshed → finished

drunk → drank（过去式）

2. 语法问题

“and I go back home drunk some baijiu” → 时态不一致 + 动词搭配不自然

“so tire” → so tired

3. 表达不自然

英语里不会说 “want to sleep” 这么直接，多用 “I feel sleepy / I’m ready to crash”。

✅ 优化后的自然美式口语版本

Today at work I wrapped up the UnitOfWork module for Atlas. When I got home, I had a little bit of baijiu, and now I’m super sleepy. I think I’m just gonna crash soon.

如果想更口语、更随意一点，也可以这样：

Finished the UnitOfWork stuff for Atlas at the office today. Got home, had some baijiu, and now I’m crazy sleepy. I’m definitely about to pass out.
