今天用claude把之前写的一段非常复杂的代码进行了重构，效果相当不错，有那种最后的程序员感觉。以后估计都是AI了 再也不需要真人程序员了。

I used Claude to recode a previously written, very complex piece of code, the results were quite good, 
It has that final programmer kind of feeling. In the future, it's probably all AI, and there'll be no need for human programmer anymore.
